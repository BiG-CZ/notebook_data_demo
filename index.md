## The Community-Driven [BiG CZ](https://bigcz.org) Software System for Integration and Analysis of Bio- and Geoscience Data in the Critical Zone

An open-source software system specifically designed to solve the challenges of managing, sharing, analyzing and integrating diverse data from of biological and geological (BiG) disciplines for [Critical Zone](http://criticalzone.org/national/research/the-critical-zone-1national/) ([CZ](http://www.czen.org)) science.

[BiG CZ software](https://github.com/BiG-CZ) is being built upon the Observations Data Model v2.0 ([ODM2](http://odm2.org)), a new information model aimed at facilitating greater interoperability across scientific disciplines and domain cyberinfrastructures that serve such diverse data as: hydrological time series, soil and sediment geochemistry, biodiversity surveys, oceanographic sensor profiles, multi-dimensional spectra, and more (Horsburgh et al. 2016).

This site hosts [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org) notebooks demonstrating the use of ODM2 and related tools to access, manage and analyze data from the Critical Zone. Most notebooks are written in Python.
